Predictive Anaysis for Human Resource.
I have carried out predictive analysis in human resource, using statistical learning. I built and trained a statistical learning model to make prediction for when an employee should be eligible for promotion in an organization. In addition, I explored if certain employee promotion had been done based on merit, and what might be responsible for a supposedly promoted employee to not have been promoted yet.
