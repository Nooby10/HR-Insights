# HR-Insights
An predictive analysis project on Human Resource.

A predictive analysis project on Human Resource. This is where I start getting my hands dirty by working on an HR data set. I go off to get the data set, clean it up, preprocess and engineer it. I will be building and training a model to predict whether or not an employee is due for promotion, on the basis of some variables.
