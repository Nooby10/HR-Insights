Predictive Anaysis for Human Resource.

I have carried out a task on predictive analysis in HR, using statistics and building a statistical learning model to make prediction for when an employee should be eligible for promotion in an organization. In addition, I explored if certain employee had been done based on merit, and what might be responsible for a supposedly promoted employee to not have been promoted yet.
